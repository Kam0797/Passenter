Hey . 

How to:
  * clone the repo/ get the .zip and eztract
  * cd Passenter
  * python passenter.py
things should go well

output:
  * two dirs are created at the path of inpit file
  * text_passenter --has passbook text
  * outputs_passenter --has output (spreadsheet) in .xlsx format 
This is a [intended to be] cool tool to convert passbooks in .pdf formats into spreadsheets
This can be helpful while feeding fin data to accounting software.

yeah.. bugs exist..
known bugs:
  * last entry doesnt appear in spreadsheet (you'd have to enter it manually)
